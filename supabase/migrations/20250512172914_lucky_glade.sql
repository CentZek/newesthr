/*
  # Fix holidays table RLS policies
  
  1. Fixes
    - Enables public access for inserting into the holidays table
    - Maintains existing policies for authenticated users
    - Allows both authenticated and anonymous users to read holidays
  
  Note: This is a temporary development solution. For production,
  you should implement proper authentication and role-based access.
