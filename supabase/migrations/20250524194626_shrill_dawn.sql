/*
  # Fix Delete Access for Processed Excel Data
  
  1. Changes
    - Create an RPC function to bypass RLS for delete operations
    - Improve delete policies on processed_excel_files table
    - Ensure cascade delete works properly
    
  2. Security
    - Function uses SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS restrictions
    - Explicit policies to allow deletion of data
