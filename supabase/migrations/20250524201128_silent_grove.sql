  # Fix Reset Button Functionality
  
  1. Changes:
    - Improve RLS policies for processed_excel_files table to ensure delete operations work correctly
    - Create a trigger to properly clean up all related data when a file is deleted
    - Add public access for deletion operations
    
  2. Data Integrity:
    - Ensure cascade deletes work properly across all related tables
    - Fix permissions to allow the Reset button to work correctly

-- Also ensure processed_employee_data has proper RLS policies

-- Ensure processed_daily_records has proper RLS policies
